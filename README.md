## Biography

An intelligent, compassionate, and hard worker in the field of Software Development and Engineering. I strive every day to understand the universe and push myself to make it just that little bit better. 

My name is Harrison Welch. I am currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Austin Peay State University expecting to graduate in May 2019.

I am passionate about Computer Engineering; both hardware, and software. I think the future of the world is found through technology so I plan to hone my software development skills not only for myself but for the entire world. I have been involved in projects using Computer Vision and Microcontrollers to aid people with disabilities such as missing limbs. Range of knowledge is a highlight of mine as I have also made mobile applications with Java and Javascript and data manipulation applications with Python and C++.

Outside of work, I like to look into random bits of knowledge usually involving history or politics. I suppose it goes without saying I love playing trivia games! I also like to chill out by playing games; usually puzzle or strategy games.
